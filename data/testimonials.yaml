    "We always book the photo pod for our Specsavers social events - it is the first
    thing we book!  It is always very popular and staff love it!  Always receive excellent service and it is
    great you can take a copy of the photo providing a nice keepsake of the event"

    "The Photo pod (with all the accessories) it great to have at any event. Itâ€™s a great reminder of a good
    party with everyone getting to keep the photo's that are produced. We have used the POD at our last 2 Christmas
    dinners and will be again this year as it helps bring the fun element to the occasion."

    "I have hired Dave's photo pod for many years now- Toddlers' parties, makeover parties, balls, proms,
    school fetes and teenage parties.  Dave is amazingly professional and patient and
    the pod is always a hit that makes an event special."
